* Visual feedback on hitting
* Very hard to see enemy bullets
* More visual feedback from driving
* Possibly add a switch view in option

Dani guapo

* Shooting is not visible
* Prefer the back view
* More explicit camera effect when speeding up

Pete looking fresh

* Feedback on hit
* There should be sound
* Pod racing controll
* Grid beneath you / compass / speedup

Ivan the terrible

* Too swingy, too much momentum
* Bullets dimension, they are too small
* Add barrel roll
* Less background movement
* Bug with bullets, they are not cleared up
* Control should be more reactive, expecially when turning
* Don't apply deceleration when turning
* Enemies should spawn in one direction
* Provide a minimap like feature
